## Flight Software/F´ Developer Workshop at JPL
 
#### Flight Software/F Prime Developer Workshop at JPL, October 21 – 23
 
This concentrated 3-day workshop covers fundamentals of flight software architecture, design, general programming practices and verification. The workshop also includes a tutorial on the F Prime open source flight software product line, which serves as the basis for a hands-on coding exercise emphasizing key concepts discussed in the workshop.
 
Topics Covered:
- Flight Software System Engineering
- Flight Software Architecture Principles
- Flight Software Design
- Coding Style
- Basic Data Structures
- Unit Testing
- Integrated Testing with a Ground Data System
- Software Development Process
- Lab assignments featuring the F Prime Flight Software Product Line
 
The workshop is free, however seating is limited and by invitation only. To be considered for an invitation, please complete this [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/C74oBJ1ZcmzeXgbL7).
 
Invitations will be issued based on availability and the information provided in the questionnaire. An initial set of invitations are expected to be issued late summer, with additional invitations issued later based on the number of participants confirmed at that point.
