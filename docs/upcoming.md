- Software Modeling using FPP, the domain specific language supporting F´
- Component Implementation
- Unit Testing
- Cross-compiling onto a small single board computer provided in class
- System Integration and Test using the F Prime Ground Data System

The tutorial itself is free, however registration is required when offered as part of a conference.
