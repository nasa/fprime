title: "F´ Tutorials"
---

These tutorials will walk the user from a basic getting-started guide through designing a full system for use with F´. This will help new
users to learn F´ and walk through the most basic steps in developing an F´ application.

## Tutorials Index

1. [HelloWorld](https://fprime-community.github.io/fprime-tutorial-hello-world/): An Introduction to F´
2. [LedBlinker](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-workshop-led-blinker/blob/main/README.md): F´ and Embedded Hardware

## [HelloWorld](https://fprime-community.github.io/fprime-tutorial-hello-world/): An Introduction to F´

The HelloWorld tutorial walks a new users through creating a new project, designing their first F´ component, and testing that
component through an F´ deployment. 



## [LedBlinker](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-workshop-led-blinker/blob/main/README.md): F´ and Embedded Hardware 

LedBlinker walks users through developing an F´ project intended for running on embedded hardware. It covers manager components, hardware drivers, and cross-compilation with the goal of blinking an LED on ARM hardware. Events, Telemetry, Commands, and Parameters are covered as well.

> This tutorial can be run without hardware with the exception of section 6 "Running on Hardware".
