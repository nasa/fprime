# Microsoft Windows 10/11 WSL

Windows 10 ships with a technology known as WSL. WSL allows users to run Linux virtual machines transparently within the Windows 10 operating system.

**Powershell: Install WSL with Default Ubuntu**
```powershell
wsl --install
```

To start Ubuntu under WSL, search for Ubuntu in the start menu and select the "Ubuntu on Windows" app. All class commands should be run on these Ubuntu terminals.

> Full instructions and troubleshooting help is available in the 
> [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

**IMPORTANT:**

Go to the [Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 / Generic](./Linux.md) Linux to finish setting up your WSL environment.
