# F´ Modeling: FPP User Guide

F´ v3 introduced a new way of modeling with F´, the FPP (F Prime Prime) modeling language. The [MathComponent Tutorial](https://fprime-community.github.io/fprime-tutorial-math-component/) is a good introduction to FPP.

To go into more detail, the full FPP documentation can be found here: [FPP Wiki](https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp/wiki).
