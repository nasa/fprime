   base.py:

   This file specifies the base-adapter for the F prime comm-layer. This class defines the basic methods needed to interact
   with various wire formats as they are supported by the F prime comm-layer. This file defines a single abstract base
   class representing the core features of the adapter class that must be implemented by every implementation of the
   adapter for use with the comm-layer.

.. py:class:: BaseAdapter

   Bases: :class:`abc.ABC`

   Base adapter for adapting the communications layer. This essentially breaks down to providing the ability to read
   data from, and write to the necessary wire-format. The children of this class must at least implement the 'read' and
   'write' functions to ensure that data can be read and written. 'open' and 'close' are also provided as a helper to
   the subclass implementor to place resource initialization and release code, however; these implementations are
   defaulted not overridden.

   .. method:: open(self)


      Null default implementation


   .. method:: close(self)


      Null default implementation


   .. method:: read(self)
      :abstractmethod:


      Read from the interface. Must be overridden by the child adapter. Throw no fatal errors, reconnect instead.

      :param size: maximum size of data to read before breaking
      :return: byte array of data, or b'' if no data was read


   .. method:: write(self, frame)
      :abstractmethod:


      Write to the interface. Must be overridden by the child adapter. Throw no fatal errors, reconnect instead.

      :param frame: framed data to uplink
      :return: True if data sent through adapter, False otherwise


   .. method:: get_arguments(cls)
      :classmethod:
      :abstractmethod:


      Returns a set of arguments consumed by this adapter. This will be consumed by the CLI layer in order to provide
      command line arguments to the user. Note: these should be globally unique args, e.g. --ip-address

      :return: dictionary, keys of tuple of arg flags and value of list of other arguments to argparse's add_argument


   .. method:: check_arguments(cls, args)
      :classmethod:
      :abstractmethod:


      Code that should check arguments of this adapter. If there is a problem with this code, then a "ValueError"
      should be raised describing the problem with these arguments.

      :param args: arguments as dictionary


   .. method:: get_adapters(cls)
      :classmethod:


      Get all known adapters of this base class. These must be imported into the comm-layer to be available to the
      system, however; they only need to be imported. Once imported this function will find them and make them
      available to the comm-layer in the standard way.

      :return: list of all imported comm adapters.


   .. method:: process_arguments(clazz, args)
      :staticmethod:


      Process arguments incoming from the command line and construct a dictionary of kwargs to supply to the chosen
      adapter at creation time. This will allow the user to choose any imported adapters at runtime.

      :param args: arguments to process
      :return: dictionary of constructor keyword arguments


   .. method:: construct_adapter(cls, adapter_name, args)
      :classmethod:


      Constructs a new adapter, from the given adapter name and the given namespace of argument inputs. This is a
      wrapper of "get_adapters" and "process_arguments" to help build a new, fully configured, adapter. This is a
      factory method.

      :param adapter_name: name of the adapter to build
      :param args: namespace of arg value to help build an adapter
      :return: newly constructed adapter
