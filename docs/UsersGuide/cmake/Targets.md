# Targets

The build system supplies the ability to register extra targets that allow the user to register new
functionality to the build system. For example, the user may wish to create a build target that
counts the total number of files in the system.  This would be the place to register such a target
and have it available to the build system.

Targets applied both at global scope, and per-module scope. Thus each target can provide a set of
build targets (one per registered module) and a global build target. For example, a counting target
might provide a `count` global target to count all files, and a `<MODULE>_count` to count the files
of a given module.

For projects generating GNU make files, these targets can be executed with the `make <target>` and
`make <MODULE>_<target>` commands. i.e. `make Svc_CmdDispatcher_coverage`.

## Built-In Targets

The CMake system supplies several targets that are useful for all projects and thus are included
as part of the CMake system. These targets are described in more detail below.

### `<MODULE>_coverage` Targets

The coverage target works on systems where the `gcov` executable is available on the executable
search path and the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable has been set to `TESTING`. If these two conditions
are met, then the user can build both the `<MODULE>_coverage` targets to run unit-tests and generate
coverage reports for the specified module.

See: [coverage.md](coverage.md)

### `dict` Target

The target system is also used to produce dictionaries. These dictionaries can be created using the
top-level `dict` target. Dictionaries do not make use of module-specific targets in terms of user
interaction.

## Adding Custom Targets

See [support/Target.md](../support/Target.md) for a description of adding custom targets.
