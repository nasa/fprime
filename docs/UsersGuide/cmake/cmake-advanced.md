# Advanced F´ CMake Usage

The CMake system has several advanced usages, described here.  This document walks through the CMake usage and settings
for users ignoring `fprime-util` and trying to run the CMake system directly.  If a user just wants to configure an IDE
integration to use CMake directly, see [IDE Configuration](../dev/configure-ide.md) first.

**Note:** `fprime-util` was designed to ease use of the F´ cmake system by wrapping all of the developer level processes
           freeing users from running these steps directly. This automatically handles the two build types using the
           developer's action to choose the correct one.

## CMake Build Types

fprime allows for two different CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE settings (specified using -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE when generating a build
cache). These two types are: Release used to build a flight-like executable, and Testing enabling debugging and unit
test features.  These are split such that testing can be done on a more permissive executable.

Running CMake directly (by hand) amounts to generating a build cache and running make (assuming GNU make output):

1. Make and change to a directory to build in: `mkdir build_dir; cd build_dir`
2. Call CMake to generate make-files: `cmake <path to deployment CMakeLists.txt> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<some type>`
3. Engage OS-specific make system: `make`
4. Run unit tests: `make check`. Note: `check` is only available in the `Testing` CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

Further information on each step is provided below.

### Make Build Directory and Generate CMake Files (Run Once Per Configuration)

When building F´ using the CMake system, each build type should be separated into its own directory.
Any time a different platform, toolchain, or option set are used, a new directory should be created.
However, each of these directories are independent, and can be built independently without cleaning
or removing the others.

The following commands will create a new build directory and generate CMake files. Separate builds
should be isolated in their own build-directories.  These directories can be achieved as
build-artifacts, but are typically not added to source management (Git).

Below, a user-provided deployment directory could be substituted for `Ref` below in-order to build a
different deployment. More on deployments below.

**Build Setup Commands**

```
# Make a build directory and change directory into it
mkdir fprime/build-dir
cd fprime/build-dir
# Run CMake to generate CMake Files (Specifically for the Ref App)
cmake ../Ref/
```

### Building Deployments (Iterated On Change)

Once generated by CMake, the cmake files typically do not need to be re-generated. If new
configuration is needed, a separate (new) build directory should be used.  If changes occur to the
CMake system, running the following steps will rerun the CMake file generation. Thus, the above
step can be run one time.  Rebuilding and iteration can be done with the following simple steps:

**Build Commands(Linux, Mac OS X)**

```
# Build the application (Will regenerate CMake if necessary)
make
# Build and run the UTs (if desired)
make check # Only if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Testing was used when generating the build cache
```


## Adding in New CMake Components and Deployments

The core of a cmake build is the `CMakeLists.txt` file. This file specifies the files needed to
build the current directory of the system. In F prime each Component, Port, and Topology get a
`CMakeList.txt` along with the top-level deployment directory.

Two templates for these CMakeLists.txt files are provided as part of the CMake system. One for
Modules that result in the creation of a library, executable, or both. The other for Deployments,
which setup the CMake for a deployment and include a number of Modules.

Components, Ports, and Topologies (`Top` folders) all use the Module template. These modules
provide libraries and executables to the system.

Top-level deployment directories (`Ref` folder) use the deployment templates. It is there to setup
the entry point to the build system.

For more on Modules, see: [module.md](module.md)
For more on Deployments, see: [deployment.md](deployment.md)


## Cross-Compiling With CMake

In order to cross compile F´ with the cmake system to some new target platform, two files are
required. These two files are a cmake toolchain file, and an F´ platform file. Once these files
have been created, a cross-compile can be setup and run with the following commands:

```
mkdir build-cross
cd build-cross
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path/to/toolchain/file> <path/to/deployment>
make
```

## CMake Customization

Sometimes users need to crack open the CMake structure in order to do things like adding an external
library/build system, adding custom make targets, building utilities, etc. These issues are described
here: [Customization](Customization.md)
