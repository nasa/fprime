# Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL)

The framework incorporates an OSAL providing service abstraction classes of a fictitious operating system that can perform all the operations of a real operating system.
This layer shows the user an abstraction of the common functionality provided by all real-time operating systems (RTEMS, VxWorks, Azure ThreadX, QNX, FreeRTOS, Zephyr,...) or not (Linux, MacOS, WinCE,...). We find the following services:

1. multitasking management with prioritization ;
2. synchronization ;
3. file management;
4. message queues;
5. communication; and
6. timeout.

OSAL provides each of these services by wrapping the concrete operating system entities it encapsulates in thin wrappers.
This layer enables the development and testing of adaptable software systems that do not depend on any particular operating system, allowing development to be performed at the development workstation. It reduces the time and effort required for developers to migrate a software system from one operating system to another.

Implementations of these classes are provided for Unix (POSIX) and Mac OS variants. Additional ports can be realized by
providing additional implementations when a new operating system is added. This guide will walk through the critical files in this layer
to allow developers to understand and provide an overview for those looking to port to a new operating system.

This guide discusses the following:
- [Tasks](#tasks)
- [Task Registry](#task-registry)
- [Mutexes](#mutexes)
- [Message Queues](#message-queues)
- [Interval Timer](#interval-timer)
- [Watchdog Timer](#watchdog-timer)
- [Interrupt Lock](#interrupt-lock)
- [File](#file)
- [FileSystem](#file-system)

## Tasks

Tasks are called threads under Unix variants, and tasks under other OSes. A
developer may wish to start tasks to wait on an event or a resource that
is not a port invocation. The Os task class definition can be found in
**Os/OsTask.hpp**. The OS implementations are found in various
subdirectories. Active components require use of tasks to implement their
features. Table 23 describes the methods of the class.

**Table 23.** Task method descriptions.

## Task Registry

Task registries are meant to be used to track all task instances in the
system. The concept is that this registry would contain pointers to all
the instances and be able to iterate over them and perform actions. The
file **Os/Task/Task.hpp** provides a base class definition of a registry
with the addTask() and removeTask() pure virtual function definitions.
Developers would write their own derived classes to implement a registry
that is appropriate for their system.

## Mutexes

The class definition can be found in **Os/Mutex.hpp**. The functions lock()
and unlock() lock and unlock the mutex. The mutex should be unlocked after
construction is complete.

## Message Queues

The class definition can be found in **Os/Queue.hpp**. This class implements
message queues. Table 24 describes the methods.

**Table 24.** Message queues method descriptions.

## Interval Timer

The class definition can be found in Os/IntervalTimer.hpp. An interval
timer is a facility that starts and stops the measurement of passage of
time in the system. It is not an expiration timer that signals when it
is complete. It is used to measure execution times of, or to timestamp,
software activities. Table 25 provides the methods and their
descriptions.

**Table 25.** Interval timer method
descriptions.

| Method                | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| start()               | Saves the start time of the timer.                                                                   |
| stop()                | Saves the stop time of the timer.                                                                    |
| getDiffUsec()         | Returns the time difference between start and stop in microseconds.                                  |
| getDiffUsec()         | Overloaded version that takes two times, subtracts them, and returns the difference in microseconds. |
| getRawTime()          | Gets the current raw time value. Can be used for time-tagging events.                                |

## Watchdog Timer

**Note:** this file implementation is not required for all OS adaptations.  Only those needing watchdog functionality.

The class definition can be found in **Os/WatchdogTimer.hpp** A watchdog
timer schedules a callback at the specified time in the future. It is a
one-shot timer; it needs to be rescheduled each time. Table 26 provides
the methods and their descriptions.

**Table 26.** Watchdog timer method descriptions.

| Method     | Description                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                        |

## Interrupt Lock

The class definition can be found in Os/InterruptLock.hpp*.* An
interrupt lock prevents interrupts from preempting code execution. It
can be used as a very lightweight mutex on platforms that support
interrupt locking, but should be used carefully as it is not subject to
priorities like a conventional mutex. In addition, it defers interrupts
that could be time critical, so the code executed between the locking
and unlocking should be very short in duration. This is a portable
interface, but the user should be aware of the behavior for each OS.
Table 27 provides the methods and their descriptions.

**Table 27.** Interrupt lock method descriptions.

| Method   | Description                                                                      |

| unlock() | Unlock interrupts.                                                               |
| getKey() | Returns the interrupt lock key, if used by the OS. This is typically not needed. |

## File

The class definition can be found in Os/File.hpp*.* The file class
attempts to abstract the most common file functions to a class interface
to make porting code that does file accesses easier. Table 28 provides
the methods and their descriptions.

## File System

The file system OS classes found in **Os/FileSystem.hpp** contains the file system helper calls to create directories
remove  directories etc.

**Note:** there is also the **Os/Directory.hpp** classes that allows users to stream directories.

## Log

This class definition can be found in **Os/Log.hpp**. It is an interface to
a system logging facility. It is meant to abstract the VxWorks logging
facility.  It is a subclass of `Fw::Logger` and thus must be registered after construction.  Compiling in
**Os/LogDefault.cpp** into your deployment will automatically create an **Os::Log** and register it.
Table 30 provides the methods and their descriptions.

|        | a1 to a6                               | Values to be printed. They will be inserted into the format string based on the format string specifiers. The type of the argument is POINTER\_CAST (normally an integer), but a typical usage is to cast the values to display to POINTER\_CAST and allow the format string extraction to get the correct value. This can include strings (char\*), but the location in memory that holds the string must persist since the format string may be printed on another task in the system. |
