description documentation (SDD) for the F´ components. Included in the Namespace and Classes sections
is the documentation of the C++ code.


\page Fw Fw Components, Ports, and Classes

The Fw package provides the core classes, components, and ports to support F´. These classes allow
for the core framework operation. In addition, these include the base classes on which components
are built.  Finally, of specific interest is Fw::Types providing the cored types in the system.


\page Os Os Components Ports and Classes

The Os package is an operating system abstraction layer. It provides basic Os system functions to
F´. This includes things like Mutexes, Queues, Tasks, and a File System.


\page Svc Svc Components, Ports, and Classes

The Svc package provides standard components to support greater F´ applications. This includes
command and data handling components used for more complete applications.


\page Drv Drv Components and Classes

The Drv package provides drivers to support various hardware functions for F´. These drivers 
include a sample block driver component as well a various drivers that support Linux hardware
functions.


\page Utils Utils Classes
