F´ (or F Prime) is a software framework for the rapid development and deployment of embedded systems and spaceflight applications.
Originally developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, F´ is open-source software that has been successfully deployed
for several space applications. It has been used for but is not limited to, CubeSats, SmallSats, instruments, and
deployable.

F´ has the following features:

- Component architecture with well-defined interfaces
- C++ framework providing core capabilities like queues, threads, and operating-system abstraction
- Tools for designing systems and automatically generating code from systems design
- A standard library of flight-worthy components
- Testing tools for unit and system-level testing
