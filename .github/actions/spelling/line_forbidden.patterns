# In English, it is generally wrong to have the same word twice in a row without punctuation.
# Duplicated words are generally mistakes.
# There are a few exceptions where it is acceptable (e.g. "that that").
# If the highlighted doubled word pair is in a code snippet, you can write a pattern to mask it.
# If the highlighted doubled word pair is in prose, have someone read the English before you dismiss this error.
