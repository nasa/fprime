# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
