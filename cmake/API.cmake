# API.cmake:
#
# API of the fprime CMake system. These functions represent the external interface to all of the fprime CMake system.
# Users and developers should understand these functions in order to perform basic CMake setup while building as part
# of an fprime project.
#
# The standard patterns include:
# - Add a directory to the fprime system. Use this in place of add_subdirectory to get cleanly organized builds.
# - Register an fprime module/executable/ut to receive the benefits of autocoding.
# - Register an fprime build target/build stage to allow custom build steps. (Experimental)

# Function `add_fprime_subdirectory`:
#
# Adds a subdirectory to the build system. This allows the system to find new available modules,
# executables, and unit tests. Every module, used or not, by the deployment/root CMAKE file should
# be added as a subdirectory somewhere in the tree. CMake's dependency system will prevent superfluous building, and
# `add_fprime_subdirectory` calls construct the super-graph from which the build graph is realized. Thus
# it is inconsequential to add a subdirectory that will not be used, but all code should be found within this
# super-graph to be available to the build.
#
# Every subdirectory added should declare a `CMakeLists.txt`. These in-turn may add their own sub-
# directories. This creates a directed acyclic graph of modules, one subgraph of which will be built
# for each executable/module/library defined in the system.  The subgraph should also be a DAG.
#
# This directory is computed based off the closest path in `FPRIME_BUILD_LOCATIONS`. It must be set to
# be used. Otherwise, an error will occur. `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` can also be supplied.
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_fprime_subdirectory.html
#
# **Note:** Replaces CMake `add_subdirectory` call in order to automate the [binary_dir] argument.
#           fprime subdirectories have specific binary roots to avoid collisions, and provide for
#           the standard fprime #include paths rooted at the root of the repo.
#
# **Arguments:**
#  - **FP_SOURCE_DIR:** directory to add (same as add_directory)
#  - **EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL:** (optional) exclude any targets from 'all'. See:
#                          https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_fprime_subdirectory.html

####
# Function `register_fprime_module`:
#
# Registers a module using the fprime build system. This comes with dependency management and fprime
# autocoding capabilities. The caller should first set two variables before calling this function to define the
# autocoding and source inputs, and (optionally) any non-standard link dependencies.
#
# Required variables (defined in calling scope):
#
# - **SOURCE_FILES:** cmake list of input source files. Place any "*.fpp", "*.c", "*.cpp"
#   etc files here. This list will be split into autocoder inputs, and hand-coded sources based on the name/type.
#
# **i.e.:**
# ```
# set(SOURCE_FILES
#     MyComponent.fpp
#     SomeFile.cpp
#     MyComponentImpl.cpp)
# ```
# - **MOD_DEPS:** (optional) cmake list of extra link dependencies. This is optional, and only
#   needed if non-standard link dependencies are used, or if a dependency cannot be inferred from the include graph of
#   the autocoder inputs to the module. If not set or supplied, only fprime inferable dependencies will be available.
#   Link flags like "-lpthread" can be added here as well. Do NOT supply executable targets in MOD_DEPS. See:
#   `register_fprime_executable` for alternatives.
#
# **i.e.:**
# ```
# set(MOD_DEPS
#     Os
#     Module1
#     Module2
#     -lpthread)
# ```
#
# ### Standard `add_fprime_module` Example ###
#
# Standard modules don't require extra modules, and define both autocoder inputs and standard source
# files. Thus, only the SOURCE_FILE variable needs to be set and then the register call can be made.
# This is the only required lines in a module CMakeLists.txt.
#
# ```
# set(SOURCE_FILE
#     MyComponent.fpp
#     SomeFile.cpp
#     MyComponentImpl.cpp)
#
# register_fprime_module()
# ```
#
# ### Non-Autocoded and Autocode-Only Modules Example ###
#
# Modules that do not require autocoding need not specify *.xml files as source. Thus, code-only modules just define
# *.cpp. **Note:** dependency inference is only done when autocoder inputs (.fpp, .xml) are supplied.
#
# ```
# set(SOURCE_FILE
#     SomeFile1.cpp
#     Another2.cpp)
#
# register_fprime_module()
# ```
# Modules requiring only autocoding may just specify *.xml files.
#
# ```
# set(SOURCE_FILE
#     MyComponent.fpp)
#
# register_fprime_module()
# ```
#
# ### Specific Dependencies and Linking in Modules Example ###
#
# Some modules need to pick a specific set of dependencies and link flags. This can be done
# with the `MOD_DEPS` variable. This feature can be used to pick specific implementations
# for some fprime modules that implement to a generic interface like the console logger implementation.
# 
# ```
# set(SOURCE_FILE
#     MyComponent.fpp
#     SomeFile.cpp
#     MyComponentImpl.cpp)
#
# set(MOD_DEPS
#     Module1
#     -lpthread)
#
# register_fprime_module()

# Function `register_fprime_executable`:
#
# Registers an executable using the fprime build system. This comes with dependency management and
# fprime autocoding capabilities. This requires three variables to define the executable name,
# autocoding and source inputs, and (optionally) any non-standard link dependencies.
#
# Note: this is not intended for deployment executables (e.g. an fprime binary) but rather for utilities,
# helper executables and tools. To register a deployment binary see `register_fprime_deployment`.
#
# Executables will automatically install itself and its dependencies into the out-of-cache build
# artifacts directory, specified by the FPRIME_INSTALL_DEST variable, when built.
#
# Required variables (defined in calling scope):
#
#
# - **EXECUTABLE_NAME:** (optional) executable name supplied. If not set, nor passed in, then
#                     FPRIME_CURRENT_MODULE from the CMake definitions is used.
#
# - **SOURCE_FILES:** cmake list of input source files. Place any "*.fpp", "*.c", "*.cpp"
#                  etc. files here. This list will be split into autocoder inputs and sources.
# **i.e.:**
# ```
# set(SOURCE_FILES
#     MyComponent.fpp
#     SomeFile.cpp
#     MyComponentImpl.cpp)
# ```
#
# - **MOD_DEPS:** (optional) cmake list of extra link dependencies. This is optional, and only
#   needed if non-standard link dependencies are used, or if a dependency cannot be inferred from the include graph of
#   the autocoder inputs to the module. If not set or supplied, only fprime
#   inferable dependencies will be available. Link flags like "-lpthread" can be here.
#
# **i.e.:**
# ```
# set(MOD_DEPS
#     Module1
#     Module2
#     -lpthread)
# ```
#
# **Note:** this operates almost identically to `register_fprime_module` with respect to the variable definitions. The
#           difference is this call will yield an optionally named linked binary executable.
#
# ### Caveats ###
#
# Executable targets should not be supplied as dependencies through MOD_DEPS  (e.g. to register_fprime_deployment).
# Doing so may cause problems with final linking of other executables due to multiple main function definitions. A
# better model would be to add a CMake only dependency without using MOD_DEPS.
#
# **Note:** these errors are definition order dependent and thus users should not supply executables through MOD_DEPS
# even if it seems to work correctly.
#
#  **i.e.:**
# ```
# set(SOURCE_FILES "tool.c")
# register_fprime_executable(TOOL)
# ...
# ...
# register_fprime_deployment(MY_DEPLOYMENT)
# add_dependencies(MY_DEPLOYMENT TOOL) # CMake only dependency

# Registers an deployment using the fprime build system. This comes with dependency management and

#
# An executable will be created and automatically install itself and its dependencies into the out-of-cache build
# artifacts directory, specified by the FPRIME_INSTALL_DEST variable, when built. This will automatically run all
# deployment targets such that the standard deployment will be built (e.g. the dictionary will be built).
#
# This is typically called from within the top-level CMakeLists.txt file that defines a deployment.
#
# Required variables (defined in calling scope):
#
# - **SOURCE_FILES:** cmake list of input source files. Place any "*.fpp", "*.c", "*.cpp"
#                     etc. files here. This list will be split into autocoder inputs and sources.

#
# - **MOD_DEPS:** cmake list of extra link dependencies. This is almost always required to supply the topology module.
#                 Other entries are only needed when they cannot be inferred from the model (e.g. linker flags). Do NOT
#                 supply executable targets in MOD_DEPS. See: `register_fprime_executable` for alternatives.

# **Note:** this operates almost identically to `register_fprime_executable` and `register_fprime_module` with respect

# Function `register_fprime_ut`:
#
# Registers an executable unit-test using the fprime build system. This comes with dependency
# management and fprime autocoding capabilities. This requires three variables defining the
# unit test name, autocoding and source inputs for the unit test, and (optionally) any
# non-standard link dependencies.
#
# **Note:** This is ONLY run when the BUILD_TESTING is enabled. Unit testing is restricted to this build type as fprime
#           sets additional flags when building for unit tests.
#
# Required variables (defined in calling scope):
#
# 
# - **UT_NAME:** (optional) executable name supplied. If not supplied, or passed in, then
#   the <MODULE_NAME>_ut_exe will be used.
#
# - **UT_SOURCE_FILES:** cmake list of UT source files. Place any "*.fpp", "*.c", "*.cpp"
#   etc. files here. This list will be split into autocoder inputs or sources. These sources only apply to the unit
#   test.
#
#  **i.e.:**
# ```
# set(UT_SOURCE_FILES
#     MyComponent.fpp
#     SomeFile.cpp
#     MyComponentImpl.cpp)
# ```
#
# - **UT_MOD_DEPS:** (optional) cmake list of extra link dependencies. This is optional, and only
#   needed if non-standard link dependencies are used. If not set or supplied, only
#   fprime detectable dependencies will be available. Link flags like "-lpthread"
#   can be supplied here.
#
# **i.e.:**
# ```
# set(UT_MOD_DEPS
#     Module1
#     Module2
#     -lpthread)
# ```
#  **Note:** this is typically called after any other register calls in the module.
#
# - **UT_AUTO_HELPERS:** (optional) When set ON, a test helper file will be generated that auto-codes the connect ports
#   and init components methods. This removes the maintenance overhead for these functions. ON additionally adds test
#   source directories to the include path for the unit test target. When set to OFF, this helper file will be created
#   when generating implementation templates allowing users to modify these files. Default: OFF
#
# ### Unit-Test Example ###
#
# A standard unit test defines only UT_SOURCES. These sources have the test cpp files and the model
# .fpp of the module being tested. This is used to generate the GTest harness.
