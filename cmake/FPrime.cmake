# FPrime.cmake:
#
# This file is the entry point for building fprime projects, libraries. It does not setup F prime as a project, but
# rather allows the users to build against fprime, fprime libraries while taking advantage of fprime's autocoding
# support. This file includes the cmake build system setup for building like fprime.
