## Unit_Test.cmake:

Testing does not properly handle unit test dependencies in some versions of CMake. Therefore,
we follow a standard workaround from CMake users and create a "check" target used to run the
tests while rolling-up the dependencies properly. Thus tests may be run using `make check` as
opposed to the standard CMake call. The CMake test support functions are still used.



## Function `unit_test_component_autocoder`:

Performs registration of the autocoder step for the generation of GTestBase.hpp, GTestBase.cpp,
TesterBase.cpp, and TesterBase.hpp. These autocoding steps automate, and keep up-to-date the
above files saving time.

- **EXE_NAME:** name of exe (unit test exe)
- **SOURCE_FILES:** source files to provide for autocoding


## Function `generate_ut`:

Generates the actual unit test, dependencies, and call the autocoder.

- **UT_EXE_NAME:** name of the UT executable to be created
- **UT_SOURCES_INPUT:** sources to split into source and autocoder file
- **MOD_DEPS_INPUT:** dependencies split into thread and module dependencies
