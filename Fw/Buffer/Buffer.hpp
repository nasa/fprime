//! Buffer used for wrapping pointer to data for efficient transmission
//!
//! Fw::Buffer is a wrapper for a pointer to data. It allows for data to be passed around the system without a copy of
//! the data itself. However, it comes with the expectation that the user maintain and protect this memory as it moves
//! about the system until such a time as it is returned.
//!
//! Fw::Buffer is composed of several elements: a U8* pointer to the data, a U32 size of that data, and a U32 context
//! describing the origin of that data, such that it may be freed at some later point. The default context of 0xFFFFFFFF
//! should not be used for tracking purposes, as it represents a context-free buffer.
//!
//! Fw::Buffer also comes with functions to return a representation of the data as a SerializeBufferBase. These two
//! functions allow easy access to the data as if it were a serialize or deserialize buffer. This can aid in writing and
//! reading the wrapped data where as the standard serialize and deserialize methods treat the data as a pointer to
//! prevent excessive copying.
//!

    //! context. The representation of that buffer for use with serialization and deserialization need not be
    //! equivalent.
