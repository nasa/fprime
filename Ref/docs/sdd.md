# Reference Deployment

## 1. Description

The reference deployment application is to demonstrate a collection of ISF components interconnected to form a deployment. The deployment represents a "reference" spacecraft that includes commanding, events, telemetry channels and parameters.

The application illustrates some example application components:

|Component|Description|Link
|---|---|---|
|SendBuffApp | A component that sends a buffer | [HTML](../SendBuffApp/docs/sdd.html) [MD](../SendBuffApp/docs/sdd.md) |
|RecvBuffApp | A component that receives a buffer | [HTML](../RecvBuffApp/docs/sdd.html) [MD](../RecvBuffApp/docs/sdd.md) |
|BlockDriver  | A notional driver that relays buffers from SendBuffApp to RecvBuffApp | [HTML](../../Drv/BlockDriver/docs/sdd.html) [MD](../../Drv/BlockDriver/docs/sdd.md)|

## 2. Topology

The topology of the reference example is the interconnection of all the components used in the reference deployment (a deployment is a set of components connected together and compiled into a binary). There are a large number of connections so it is not feasible to show them all in one diagram. The following sections have views of the topology that show the connections for a particular purpose. The topology diagrams will be broken down into the core set of Command and Data Handling (C&DH) connections that would be reused from project to project as well as the connections unique to the reference example. The diagrams were generated using MagicDraw, while the [XML](../Top/RefTopologyAppAi.xml) defining the topology connections was generated using the MagicDraw plug-in developed for ISF.

### 2.1 Commanding

The commanding view consists of connections for components to register commands, the dispatching of commands and the return of command execution status. 

#### 2.1.1 C&DH Commanding

The connections for the C&DH commanding are as follows:

#### 2.1.2 Reference Deployment Commanding

The connections for the reference deployment commanding are as follows:

### 2.4 Parameters

The parameters view consists of connections for components to retrieve and update parameters stored in the `PrmDb` component. 

#### 2.3.1 C&DH Parameters

The core C&DH components do not have any parameters.

#### 2.3.2 Reference Deployment Parameters

### 2.5 Time

The time view consists of connections for components to get time for time-tagging events and telemetry.

### 2.6 Health

The health view consists of connections for components to respond to pings from `Health`to verify their threads are alive.

### 2.7 Rate Groups

The rate group view consists of connections for components to be executed at different rates in the reference topology. 

The connections for the rate groups are as follows:

![Rate Groups](img/ibd__Ref__Rate_Groups.jpg)

### 2.8 Ground

The ground view consists of connections for C&DH components to receive commands from and send telemetry to a ground system. The ground system in the reference example is communicated with via a TCP/IP socket. 

The connections for the ground system are as follows:

![Ground System](img/ibd__Ref__Ground.jpg)

### 2.9 Drivers

The drivers view consists of connections for the reference components to send packets to and from the example "driver." The driver also provides ticks to the `RateGroupDriver` component that cycles the rate groups.

The connections for the drivers are as follows:
