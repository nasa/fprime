c-ares version 1.18.1

This is an urgent bugfix release for a regression made in 1.18.0.

Bug fixes:
 o ares_getaddrinfo() would return ai_addrlen of 16 for ipv6
   adddresses rather than the sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6)



c-ares version 1.18.0

This is a feature and bugfix release.  It addresses a couple of new feature
requests as well as a couple of bug fixes.

Changes:
 o Add support for URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) records via
   ares_parse_uri_reply() [1]
 o Provide ares_nameser.h as a public interface as needed by NodeJS [5]
 o Update URLs from c-ares.haxx.se to c-ares.org [9]
 o During a domain search, treat ARES_ENODATA as ARES_NXDOMAIN so that the
   search process will continue to the next domain in the search.  [11]
 o Turn ares_gethostbyname() into a wrapper for ares_getaddrinfo() as they
   followed very similar code paths and ares_gethostbyaddr() has some more
   desirable features such as priority sorting and parallel queries for
   AF_UNSPEC. [12]
 o ares_getaddrinfo() now contains a name element in the address info
   structure as the last element.  This is not an API or ABI break due to
   the structure always being internally allocated and it being the last
   element. [12]
 o ares_parse_a_reply() and ares_parse_aaaa_reply() were nearly identical, those
   now use the same helper functions for parsing rather than having their own
   code. [12]
 o RFC6761 Section 6.3 says "localhost" lookups need to be special cased to
   return loopback addresses, and not forward queries to recursive dns servers.
   On Windows this now returns all loopback addresses, on other systems it
   returns 127.0.0.1 or ::1 always, and will never forward a request for
   "localhost" to outside DNS servers. [13]
 o Haiki: port [14]

Bug fixes:
 o add build to .gitignore [2]
 o z/OS minor update, add missing semicolon in ares_init.c [3]
 o Fix building when latest ax_code_coverage.m4 is imported [4]
 o Work around autotools 'error: too many loops' and other newer autotools
   import related bugs.
 o MinGW cross builds need advapi32 link as lower case [6]
 o Cygwin build fix due to containing both socket.h and winsock2.h [7]
 o ares_expand_name should allow underscores (_) as SRV records legitimately use
   them [8]
 o Allow '/' as a valid character for a returned name for CNAME in-addr.arpa
   delegation [10]
 o ares_getaddrinfo() was not honoring HOSTALIASES [12]
 o ares_getaddrinfo() had some test cases disabled due to a bug in the test
   framework itself which has now been resolved [12]
 o Due to Travis-CI becoming unfriendly to open-source, Cirrus-CI has now been
   brought online for automated unit testing.
