\fBnpm-publish\fR \- Publish a package
.SS Synopsis
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm publish [<folder>]
.fi
.RE
.SS Description
.P
Publishes a package to the registry so that it can be installed by name\.
.P
By default npm will publish to the public registry\. This can be overridden
by specifying a different default registry or using a
npm help \fBscope\fP in the name (see
npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP)\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<folder>\fP: A folder containing a package\.json file
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<tarball>\fP: A url or file path to a gzipped tar archive containing a
single folder with a package\.json file inside\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB[\-\-tag <tag>]\fP: Registers the published package with the given tag, such
that \fBnpm install <name>@<tag>\fP will install this version\.  By default,
\fBnpm publish\fP updates and \fBnpm install\fP installs the \fBlatest\fP tag\. See
\fBnpm\-dist\-tag\fP \fInpm\-dist\-tag\fR for details about tags\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB[\-\-access <public|restricted>]\fP: Tells the registry whether this package
should be published as public or restricted\. Only applies to scoped
packages, which default to \fBrestricted\fP\|\.  If you don't have a paid
account, you must publish with \fB\-\-access public\fP to publish scoped
packages\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB[\-\-otp <otpcode>]\fP: If you have two\-factor authentication enabled in
\fBauth\-and\-writes\fP mode then you can provide a code from your
authenticator with this\. If you don't include this and you're running
from a TTY then you'll be prompted\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB[\-\-dry\-run]\fP: As of \fBnpm@6\fP, does everything publish would do except
actually publishing to the registry\. Reports the details of what would
have been published\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB[\-\-workspaces]\fP: Enables workspace context while publishing\. All
workspace packages will be published\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB[\-\-workspace]\fP: Enables workspaces context and limits results to only
those specified by this config item\.  Only the packages in the
workspaces given will be published\.

.RE
.P
The publish will fail if the package name and version combination already
exists in the specified registry\.
.P
Once a package is published with a given name and version, that specific
name and version combination can never be used again, even if it is removed
with npm help \fBunpublish\fP\|\.
.P
As of \fBnpm@5\fP, both a sha1sum and an integrity field with a sha512sum of the
tarball will be submitted to the registry during publication\. Subsequent
installs will use the strongest supported algorithm to verify downloads\.
.P
Similar to \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP see npm help \fBpack\fP, which figures
out the files to be included and packs them into a tarball to be uploaded
to the registry\.
.SS Files included in package
.P
To see what will be included in your package, run \fBnpx npm\-packlist\fP\|\.  All
files are included by default, with the following exceptions:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Certain files that are relevant to package installation and distribution
are always included\.  For example, \fBpackage\.json\fP, \fBREADME\.md\fP,
\fBLICENSE\fP, and so on\.
.IP \(bu 2
If there is a "files" list in
npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP, then only the files
specified will be included\.  (If directories are specified, then they
will be walked recursively and their contents included, subject to the
same ignore rules\.)
.IP \(bu 2
If there is a \fB\|\.gitignore\fP or \fB\|\.npmignore\fP file, then ignored files in
that and all child directories will be excluded from the package\.  If
\fIboth\fR files exist, then the \fB\|\.gitignore\fP is ignored, and only the
\fB\|\.npmignore\fP is used\.
\fB\|\.npmignore\fP files follow the same pattern
rules \fIhttps://git\-scm\.com/book/en/v2/Git\-Basics\-Recording\-Changes\-to\-the\-Repository#_ignoring\fR
as \fB\|\.gitignore\fP files
.IP \(bu 2
If the file matches certain patterns, then it will \fInever\fR be included,
unless explicitly added to the \fB"files"\fP list in \fBpackage\.json\fP, or
un\-ignored with a \fB!\fP rule in a \fB\|\.npmignore\fP or \fB\|\.gitignore\fP file\.
.IP \(bu 2
Symbolic links are never included in npm packages\.

.RE
.P
See npm help \fBdevelopers\fP for full details on what's
included in the published package, as well as details on how the package is
built\.
.SS Configuration
.SS \fBtag\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: "latest"
.IP \(bu 2
Type: String

.RE
.P
If you ask npm to install a package and don't tell it a specific version,
then it will install the specified tag\.
.P
Also the tag that is added to the package@version specified by the \fBnpm tag\fP
command, if no explicit tag is given\.
.P
When used by the \fBnpm diff\fP command, this is the tag used to fetch the
tarball that will be compared with the local files by default\.
.SS \fBaccess\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: 'restricted' for scoped packages, 'public' for unscoped packages
.IP \(bu 2
Type: null, "restricted", or "public"

.RE
.P
When publishing scoped packages, the access level defaults to \fBrestricted\fP\|\.
If you want your scoped package to be publicly viewable (and installable)
set \fB\-\-access=public\fP\|\. The only valid values for \fBaccess\fP are \fBpublic\fP and
\fBrestricted\fP\|\. Unscoped packages \fIalways\fR have an access level of \fBpublic\fP\|\.
.P
Note: Using the \fB\-\-access\fP flag on the \fBnpm publish\fP command will only set
the package access level on the initial publish of the package\. Any
subsequent \fBnpm publish\fP commands using the \fB\-\-access\fP flag will not have an
effect to the access level\. To make changes to the access level after the
initial publish use \fBnpm access\fP\|\.
.SS \fBdry\-run\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done\. This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, \fBinstall\fP, \fBupdate\fP,
\fBdedupe\fP, \fBuninstall\fP, as well as \fBpack\fP and \fBpublish\fP\|\.
.P
Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg \fBdist\-tags\fP,
\fBowner\fP, etc\.
.SS \fBotp\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: null
.IP \(bu 2
Type: null or String

.RE
.P
This is a one\-time password from a two\-factor authenticator\. It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with \fBnpm access\fP\|\.
.P
If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one\-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one\.
.SS \fBworkspace\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default:
.IP \(bu 2
Type: String (can be set multiple times)

.RE
.P
Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option\.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fP config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
workspaces within that folder)

.RE
.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fP command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project\.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.
.SS \fBworkspaces\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: null
.IP \(bu 2
Type: null or Boolean

.RE
.P
Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured
workspaces\.
.P
Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fP to
ignore workspaces altogether\. When not set explicitly:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fP tree (install, update, etc\.)
will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fP folder\. \- Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc\.) will operate on the root project,
\fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fP config\.

.RE
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.
.SS \fBinclude\-workspace\-root\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command\.
.P
When false, specifying individual workspaces via the \fBworkspace\fP config, or
all workspaces via the \fBworkspaces\fP flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project\.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.
