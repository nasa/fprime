You may of course also pipe the output of \fBnpm completion\fP to a file
such as \fB/usr/local/etc/bash_completion\.d/npm\fP or 
\fB/etc/bash_completion\.d/npm\fP if you have a system that will read 
that file for you\.
.P
When \fBCOMP_CWORD\fP, \fBCOMP_LINE\fP, and \fBCOMP_POINT\fP are defined in the
environment, \fBnpm completion\fP acts in "plumbing mode", and outputs
completions based on the arguments\.
