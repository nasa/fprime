\fBnpm-update\fR \- Update packages
.SS Synopsis

.nf
npm update [<pkg>\.\.\.]

aliases: up, upgrade, udpate
.fi
.RE
.SS Description
.P
This command will update all the packages listed to the latest version
(specified by the \fBtag\fP config), respecting the semver constraints of
both your package and its dependencies (if they also require the same
package)\.
.P
It will also install missing packages\.
.P
If the \fB\-g\fP flag is specified, this command will update globally installed
packages\.
.P
If no package name is specified, all packages in the specified location (global
or local) will be updated\.
.P
Note that by default \fBnpm update\fP will not update the semver values of direct
dependencies in your project \fBpackage\.json\fP, if you want to also update
values in \fBpackage\.json\fP you can run: \fBnpm update \-\-save\fP (or add the
\fBsave=true\fP option to a npm help configuration file
to make that the default behavior)\.
.SS Example
.P
For the examples below, assume that the current package is \fBapp\fP and it depends
on dependencies, \fBdep1\fP (\fBdep2\fP, \.\. etc\.)\.  The published versions of \fBdep1\fP
are:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "dist\-tags": { "latest": "1\.2\.2" },
  "versions": [
    "1\.2\.2",
    "1\.2\.1",
    "1\.2\.0",
    "1\.1\.2",
    "1\.1\.1",
    "1\.0\.0",
    "0\.4\.1",
    "0\.4\.0",
    "0\.2\.0"
  ]
}
.fi
.RE
.SS Caret Dependencies
.P
If \fBapp\fP\|'s \fBpackage\.json\fP contains:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"dependencies": {
  "dep1": "^1\.1\.1"
}
.fi
.RE
.P
Then \fBnpm update\fP will install \fBdep1@1\.2\.2\fP, because \fB1\.2\.2\fP is \fBlatest\fP and
\fB1\.2\.2\fP satisfies \fB^1\.1\.1\fP\|\.
.SS Tilde Dependencies
.P
However, if \fBapp\fP\|'s \fBpackage\.json\fP contains:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"dependencies": {
  "dep1": "~1\.1\.1"
}
.fi
.RE
.P
In this case, running \fBnpm update\fP will install \fBdep1@1\.1\.2\fP\|\.  Even though the
\fBlatest\fP tag points to \fB1\.2\.2\fP, this version do not satisfy \fB~1\.1\.1\fP, which is
equivalent to \fB>=1\.1\.1 <1\.2\.0\fP\|\.  So the highest\-sorting version that satisfies
\fB~1\.1\.1\fP is used, which is \fB1\.1\.2\fP\|\.
.SS Caret Dependencies below 1\.0\.0
.P
Suppose \fBapp\fP has a caret dependency on a version below \fB1\.0\.0\fP, for example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"dependencies": {
  "dep1": "^0\.2\.0"
}
.fi
.RE
.P
\fBnpm update\fP will install \fBdep1@0\.2\.0\fP, because there are no other
versions which satisfy \fB^0\.2\.0\fP\|\.
.P
If the dependence were on \fB^0\.4\.0\fP:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"dependencies": {
  "dep1": "^0\.4\.0"
}
.fi
.RE
.P
Then \fBnpm update\fP will install \fBdep1@0\.4\.1\fP, because that is the highest\-sorting
version that satisfies \fB^0\.4\.0\fP (\fB>= 0\.4\.0 <0\.5\.0\fP)
.SS Subdependencies
.P
Suppose your app now also has a dependency on \fBdep2\fP
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "name": "my\-app",
  "dependencies": {
      "dep1": "^1\.0\.0",
      "dep2": "1\.0\.0"
  }
}
.fi
.RE
.P
and \fBdep2\fP itself depends on this limited range of \fBdep1\fP
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
"name": "dep2",
  "dependencies": {
    "dep1": "~1\.1\.1"
  }
}
.fi
.RE
.P
Then \fBnpm update\fP will install \fBdep1@1\.1\.2\fP because that is the highest
version that \fBdep2\fP allows\.  npm will prioritize having a single version
of \fBdep1\fP in your tree rather than two when that single version can
satisfy the semver requirements of multiple dependencies in your tree\.
In this case if you really did need your package to use a newer version
you would need to use \fBnpm install\fP\|\.
.SS Updating Globally\-Installed Packages
.P
\fBnpm update \-g\fP will apply the \fBupdate\fP action to each globally installed
package that is \fBoutdated\fP \-\- that is, has a version that is different from
\fBwanted\fP\|\.
.P
Note: Globally installed packages are treated as if they are installed with a
caret semver range specified\. So if you require to update to \fBlatest\fP you may
need to run \fBnpm install \-g [<pkg>\.\.\.]\fP
.P
NOTE: If a package has been upgraded to a version newer than \fBlatest\fP, it will
be \fIdowngraded\fR\|\.

.RE
.P
Save installed packages to a \fBpackage\.json\fP file as dependencies\.
.P
When used with the \fBnpm rm\fP command, removes the dependency from

.P
Will also prevent writing to \fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP if set to \fBfalse\fP\|\.

.RE
.SS \fBglobal\-style\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
Causes npm to install the package into your local \fBnode_modules\fP folder with
the same layout it uses with the global \fBnode_modules\fP folder\. Only your
direct dependencies will show in \fBnode_modules\fP and everything they depend
on will be flattened in their \fBnode_modules\fP folders\. This obviously will
eliminate some deduping\. If used with \fBlegacy\-bundling\fP, \fBlegacy\-bundling\fP
will be preferred\.
.SS \fBlegacy\-bundling\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
Causes npm to install the package such that versions of npm prior to 1\.4,
such as the one included with node 0\.8, can install the package\. This
eliminates all automatic deduping\. If used with \fBglobal\-style\fP this option
will be preferred\.
.SS \fBomit\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: 'dev' if the \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment variable is set to
\|'production', otherwise empty\.
.IP \(bu 2

.RE
.P
Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk\.
.P
Note that these dependencies \fIare\fR still resolved and added to the
\fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP or \fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP file\. They are just not
physically installed on disk\.
.P
If a package type appears in both the \fB\-\-include\fP and \fB\-\-omit\fP lists, then
it will be included\.
.P
If the resulting omit list includes \fB\|'dev'\fP, then the \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment
variable will be set to \fB\|'production'\fP for all lifecycle scripts\.
.SS \fBstrict\-peer\-deps\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
If set to \fBtrue\fP, and \fB\-\-legacy\-peer\-deps\fP is not set, then \fIany\fR
conflicting \fBpeerDependencies\fP will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non\-peer
dependency relationships\.
.P
By default, conflicting \fBpeerDependencies\fP deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non\-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's \fBpeerDependencies\fP object\.
.P
When such and override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved\. If \fB\-\-strict\-peer\-deps\fP is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure\.
.SS \fBpackage\-lock\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: true
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
If set to false, then ignore \fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP files when installing\. This
will also prevent \fIwriting\fR \fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP if \fBsave\fP is true\.
.P
This configuration does not affect \fBnpm ci\fP\|\.
.SS \fBforeground\-scripts\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
Run all build scripts (ie, \fBpreinstall\fP, \fBinstall\fP, and \fBpostinstall\fP)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process\.
.P
Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging\.
.SS \fBignore\-scripts\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package\.json files\.
.P
Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
\fBnpm start\fP, \fBnpm stop\fP, \fBnpm restart\fP, \fBnpm test\fP, and \fBnpm run\-script\fP
will still run their intended script if \fBignore\-scripts\fP is set, but they
will \fInot\fR run any pre\- or post\-scripts\.
