\fBnpm-fund\fR \- Retrieve funding information

npm fund [[<@scope>/]<pkg>]

.SS Description
.P
This command retrieves information on how to fund the dependencies of a
given project\. If no package name is provided, it will list all
dependencies that are looking for funding in a tree structure, listing the
type of funding and the url to visit\. If a package name is provided then it
tries to open its funding url using the \fB\-\-browser\fP config param; if there
are multiple funding sources for the package, the user will be instructed
to pass the \fB\-\-which\fP option to disambiguate\.
.P
The list will avoid duplicated entries and will stack all packages that
share the same url as a single entry\. Thus, the list does not have the same
shape of the output from \fBnpm ls\fP\|\.
.SS Example
.SS Workspaces support
.P
It's possible to filter the results to only include a single workspace and its
dependencies using the \fBworkspace\fP config option\.
.SS Example:
.P
Here's an example running \fBnpm fund\fP in a project with a configured
workspace \fBa\fP:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
$ npm fund
test\-workspaces\-fund@1\.0\.0
+\-\- https://example\.com/a
| | `\-\- a@1\.0\.0
| `\-\- https://example\.com/maintainer
|     `\-\- foo@1\.0\.0
+\-\- https://example\.com/npmcli\-funding
|   `\-\- @npmcli/test\-funding
`\-\- https://example\.com/org
    `\-\- bar@2\.0\.0
.fi

And here is an example of the expected result when filtering only by
a specific workspace \fBa\fP in the same project:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
$ npm fund \-w a
test\-workspaces\-fund@1\.0\.0
`\-\- https://example\.com/a
  | `\-\- a@1\.0\.0
  `\-\- https://example\.com/maintainer
      `\-\- foo@2\.0\.0

Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 2

When set for the \fBnpm init\fP command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
