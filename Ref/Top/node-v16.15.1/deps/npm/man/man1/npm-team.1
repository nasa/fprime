.SS Description
.P
Used to manage teams in organizations, and change team memberships\. Does not
handle permissions for packages\.
.P
Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to
when operating on them, separated by a colon (\fB:\fP)\. That is, if you have a
\fBnewteam\fP team in an \fBorg\fP organization, you must always refer to that team
as \fB@org:newteam\fP in these commands\.
.P
If you have two\-factor authentication enabled in \fBauth\-and\-writes\fP mode, then
you can provide a code from your authenticator with \fB[\-\-otp <otpcode>]\fP\|\.
If you don't include this then you will be prompted\.

.SS Details
.P
\fBnpm team\fP always operates directly on the current registry, configurable from
the command line using \fB\-\-registry=<registry url>\fP\|\.
.P
You must be a \fIteam admin\fR to create teams and manage team membership, under
the given organization\. Listing teams and team memberships may be done by
any member of the organization\.
