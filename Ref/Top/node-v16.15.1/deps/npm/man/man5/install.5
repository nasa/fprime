\fBinstall\fR \- Download and install node and npm
.SS Description
.P
To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry, you
must install Node\.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node
version manager or a Node installer\. \fBWe strongly recommend using a Node
version manager to install Node\.js and npm\.\fR We do not recommend using a
Node installer, since the Node installation process installs npm in a
directory with local permissions and can cause permissions errors when you
run npm packages globally\.

.SS Using a Node version manager to install Node\.js and npm
.P
Node version managers allow you to install and switch between multiple
versions of Node\.js and npm on your system so you can test your
applications on multiple versions of npm to ensure they work for users on
different versions\.
