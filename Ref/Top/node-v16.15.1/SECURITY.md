## Reporting a bug in Node.js

Report security bugs in Node.js via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/nodejs).

Your report will be acknowledged within 5 days, and you’ll receive a more
detailed response to your report within 10 days indicating the next steps in
handling your submission.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep
you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance surrounding the reported
issue.

### Node.js bug bounty program

The Node.js project engages in an official bug bounty program for security
researchers and responsible public disclosures.  The program is managed through
the HackerOne platform. See <https://hackerone.com/nodejs> for further details.

## Reporting a bug in a third party module

Security bugs in third party modules should be reported to their respective
maintainers.

## Disclosure policy

Here is the security disclosure policy for Node.js

* The security report is received and is assigned a primary handler. This
  person will coordinate the fix and release process. The problem is confirmed
  and a list of all affected versions is determined. Code is audited to find
  any potential similar problems. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are
  still under maintenance. These fixes are not committed to the public
  repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.

* A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen and a CVE (Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®)) is requested for the vulnerability.

* On the embargo date, the Node.js security mailing list is sent a copy of the
  announcement. The changes are pushed to the public repository and new builds
  are deployed to nodejs.org. Within 6 hours of the mailing list being
  notified, a copy of the advisory will be published on the Node.js blog.

* Typically the embargo date will be set 72 hours from the time the CVE is
  issued. However, this may vary depending on the severity of the bug or
  difficulty in applying a fix.

* This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required
  with maintainers of other projects. Every effort will be made to handle the
  bug in as timely a manner as possible; however, it’s important that we follow
  the release process above to ensure that the disclosure is handled in a
  consistent manner.

## Receiving security updates

Security notifications will be distributed via the following methods.

* <https://groups.google.com/group/nodejs-sec>
* <https://nodejs.org/en/blog/>

## Comments on this policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org) or
