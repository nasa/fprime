#### class fprime_gds.common.testing_fw.api.IntegrationTestAPI(pipeline, logpath=None, fsw_order=True)
Bases: `object`

A value used to begin searches after the current contents in a history and only search future
items


#### __init__(pipeline, logpath=None, fsw_order=True)
Initializes API: constructs and registers test histories.
Args:

> pipeline: a pipeline object providing access to basic GDS functionality
> logpath: an optional output destination for the api test log
> fsw_order: a flag to determine whether the API histories will maintain FSW time order.


#### teardown()
To be called once at the end of the API’s use. Closes the test log and clears histories.


#### start_test_case(case_name, case_id)
To be called at the start of a test case. This function inserts a log message to denote a
new test case is beginning, records the latest time stamp in case the user clears the
aggregate histories, and then clears the API’s histories.

Args:

    case_name: the name of the test case (str)
    case_id: a short identifier to denote the test case (str or number)


#### log(msg, color=None)
User-accessible function to log user messages to the test log.
Args:

> msg: a user-provided message to add to the test log. (str)
> color: a string containing a color hex code “######” (str)


#### get_latest_time()
Finds the latest flight software time received by either history.

Returns:

    a flight software timestamp (TimeType)


#### test_assert(value, msg='', expect=False)
this assert gives the user the ability to add formatted assert messages to the test log and
raise an assertion.
Args:

> value: a boolean value that determines if the assert is successful.
> msg: a string describing what is checked by the assert.
> expect: when True, the call will behave as an expect, and will skip the assert (boolean)

Return:

    True if the assert was successful, False otherwise


#### predicate_assert(predicate, value, msg='', expect=False)
API assert gives the user the ability to add formatted assert messages to the test log and
raise an assertion.
Args:

> value: the value to be evaluated by the predicate. (object)
> predicate: an instance of predicate that will decided if the test passes (predicate)
> msg: a string describing what is checked by the assert. (str)
> expect: when True, the call will behave as an expect, and will skip the assert (boolean)

Return:

    True if the assert was successful, False otherwise


#### clear_histories(time_stamp=None)
Clears the IntegrationTestAPI’s histories. Because the command history is not correlated to
a flight software timestamp, it will be cleared entirely. This function can be used to set
up test cases so that the IntegrationTestAPI’s histories only contain objects received
during that test.
Note: this will not clear user-created sub-histories nor the aggregate histories (histories
owned by the GDS)

Args:

    time_stamp: If specified, histories are only cleared before the timestamp.


#### set_event_log_filter(event=None, args=None, severity=None, time_pred=None)
Constructs an event predicate that is then used to filter which events are interlaced in the
test logs. This method replaces the current filter. Calling this method with no arguments
will effectively reset the filter.

Args:

    event: an optional mnemonic (str), id (int), or predicate to specify the event type
    args: an optional list of arguments (list of values, predicates, or None to ignore)
    severity: an EventSeverity enum or a predicate to specify the event severity
    time_pred: an optional predicate to specify the flight software timestamp


#### get_command_test_history()
Accessor for IntegrationTestAPI’s command history
Returns:

> a history of CmdData objects


#### get_telemetry_test_history()
Accessor for IntegrationTestAPI’s telemetry history
Returns:

> a history of ChData objects


#### get_event_test_history()
Accessor for IntegrationTestAPI’s event history
Returns:

> a history of EventData objects


#### get_telemetry_subhistory(telemetry_filter=None, fsw_order=True)
Returns a new instance of TestHistory that will be updated with new telemetry updates as
they come in. Specifying a filter will only enqueue updates that satisfy the filter in this
new sub-history. The returned history can be substituted into the await and assert methods
of this API.

Args:

    telemetry_filter: an optional predicate used to filter a subhistory.
    fsw_order: a flag to determine whether this subhistory will maintain FSW time order.

Returns:

    an instance of TestHistory


#### remove_telemetry_subhistory(subhist)
De-registers the subhistory from the GDS. Once called, the given subhistory will stop
receiving telemetry updates.

Args:

    subhist: a TestHistory instance that is subscribed to event messages

Returns:

    True if the subhistory was removed, False otherwise


#### get_event_subhistory(event_filter=None, fsw_order=True)
Returns a new instance of TestHistory that will be updated with new events as they come in.
Specifying a filter will only enqueue events that satisfy the filter in this new
sub-history. The returned history can be substituted into the await and assert methods of
this API.

Args:

    event_filter: an optional predicate to filter a subhistory.
    fsw_order: a flag to determine whether this subhistory will maintain FSW time order.

Returns:

    an instance of TestHistory


#### remove_event_subhistory(subhist)
De-registers the subhistory from the GDS. Once called, the given subhistory will stop
receiving event messages.

Args:

    subhist: a TestHistory instance that is subscribed to event messages

Returns:

    True if the subhistory was removed, False otherwise


#### translate_command_name(command)

#### get_telemetry_pred(channel=None, value=None, time_pred=None)
This function will translate the channel ID, and construct a telemetry_predicate object. It
is used as a helper by the IntegrationTestAPI, but could also be helpful to a user of the
test API. If  channel is already an instance of telemetry_predicate, it will be returned
immediately. The provided implementation of telemetry_predicate evaluates true if and only
if all specified constraints are satisfied. If a specific constraint isn’t specified, then
it will not effect the outcome; this means all arguments are optional. If no constraints
are specified, the predicate will always return true.

Args:

    channel: an optional mnemonic (str), id (int), or predicate to specify the channel type
    value: an optional value (object/number) or predicate to specify the value field
    time_pred: an optional predicate to specify the flight software timestamp

Returns:

    the ChData object found during the search, otherwise, None


#### await_telemetry_sequence(channels, history=None, start='NOW', timeout=5)
A search for a sequence of telemetry updates. By default, the call will only await until
the sequence is completed. The user can specify that await also searches the history by
specifying a value for start. On timeout, the search will return the list of found
channel updates regardless of whether the sequence is complete.
Note: It is reccomended (but not enforced) not to specify timestamps for this assert.
Note: This function will always return a list of updates. The user should check if the
sequence was completed.

Args:

    channels: an ordered list of channel specifiers (mnemonic, id, or predicate)
    history: if given, a substitute history that the function will search and await
    start: an optional index or predicate to specify the earliest item to search

history by specifying a value for start. On timeout, the search will return the list of
found channel updates regardless of whether a correct count is achieved.
Note: this search will always return a list of objects. The user should check if the search
was completed.

Args:

    count: either an exact amount (int) or a predicate to specify how many objects to find
    channels: a channel specifier or list of channel specifiers (mnemonic, ID, or predicate)

correct update, the call will await until a correct update is received or the
timeout, at which point it will assert failure.

Args:

    channel: a channel specifier (mnemonic, id, or predicate)
    value: optional value (object/number) or predicate to specify the value field
    time_pred: an optional predicate to specify the flight software timestamp
