"""
jsonable.py:

Folder with helper methods that allow for seamless conversion of F prime types to JSON types. This allows us to produce
data in JSON format with ease, assuming that the correct encoder is registered.

Note: JSON types must use only the following data types

 1. booleans
 2. numbers
 3. strings
 4. lists
 5. anonymous objects (dictionaries)
