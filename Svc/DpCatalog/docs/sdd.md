# Svc::DpCatalog Component

## 1 Introduction

`DpCatalog` is an active FÂ´ component that manages the downlink of generate data products. The data products were previously generated by components into a project-specific set of directories. Upon command, `DpCatalog` will build a catalog of data existing products and start downloading them. They are downloaded based on a priority stored in the file and by generation time. `DpCatalog` also has commands to reprioritize and delete data products.

## 2 Requirements

Requirement | Description | Rationale | Verification Method
---- | ---- | ---- | ----
SVC-DPCAT-001 | `DpCatalog` shall read a set of directories and build a list of data products. | `DpCatalog` needs to know at least one directory where data products reside  | Test
SVC-DPCAT-002 | `DpCatalog` shall sort data products first based on the internally recorded priority. | `DpCatalog` needs to downlink highest priority items first | Test
SVC-DPCAT-003 | `DpCatalog` shall sort data products second based on the internally recorded time with oldest products as higher priority. | `DpCatalog` needs to downlink oldest items first | Test
SVC-DPCAT-004 | `DpCatalog` shall provide a command to build the catalog. | `DpCatalog` needs to downlink oldest items first | Test
SVC-DPCAT-005 | `DpCatalog` shall provide a way to insert newly-generated data products into the catalog after the catalog is built | `DpCatalog` should notice new products and not require a rebuild of the catalog | Test


## 3 Design

### 3.1 Assumptions

The design of `FileDownlink` assumes the following:

1. File downlink occurs by dividing files into packets
of type [`Fw::FilePacket`](../../../Fw/FilePacket/docs/sdd.html).

2. One file downlink happens at a time.

3. Both components and operators must be able to enqueue files, necessitating both a `SendFile`
   command and port.

### 3.3 Ports

#### 3.3.1 Role Ports

Name | Type | Role
-----| ---- | ----
`timeCaller` | `Fw::Time` | TimeGet
`cmdIn` | [`Fw::Cmd`](../../../Fw/Cmd/docs/sdd.html) | Cmd
`cmdRegOut` | [`Fw::CmdReg`](../../../Fw/Cmd/docs/sdd.html) | CmdReg
`cmdResponseOut` | [`Fw::CmdResponse`](../../../Fw/Cmd/docs/sdd.html) | CmdResponse
`tlmOut` | [`Fw::Tlm`](../../../Fw/Tlm/docs/sdd.html) | Telemetry
`eventOut` | [`Fw::LogEvent`](../../../Fw/Log/docs/sdd.html) | LogEvent

#### 3.3.2 Component-Specific Ports

Name | Type | Kind | Purpose
---- | ---- | ---- | ----
`sendFile` | `Svc::SendFileRequest` | guarded_input | Enqueues file for downlink
`fileComplete` | `Svc::SendFileComplete` | output | Emits notifications when a file downlink initiated by a port completes
`Run` | `Svc::Sched` | async_input | Periodic clock input used to trigger internal state machine
<a name="bufferGet">`bufferGet`</a> | [`Fw::BufferGet`](../../../Fw/Buffer/docs/sdd.html) | output (caller) | Requests buffers for sending file packets.
<a name="bufferSendOut">`bufferSendOut`</a> | [`Fw::BufferSend`](../../../Fw/Buffer/docs/sdd.html) | output | Sends buffers containing file packets.

### 3.4 Constants

`FileDownlink` has the following constants, initialized
at component instantiation time:

* *downlinkPacketSize*: The size of the packets to use on downlink.
* *timeout*: Max amount of time in ms to wait for a buffer return before aborting downlink
* *cooldown*: The amount of time in ms to wait in a cooldown state before starting next downlink.
* *cycle time*: Frequency in ms of clock pulses sent to `Run` port, used for timing timeouts and
  cooldown.
* *file queue depth*: The maximum number of files that can be held in the internal file downlink
  queue. Attempting to dispatch a SendFile command or port call while the queue is full will result
  in a busy error response.

### 3.5 State

`FileDownlink` maintains a *mode* equal to
one of the following values:

* IDLE (0): `FileDownlink` is idle.

* DOWNLINK (1): `FileDownlink` is performing a file downlink.

* CANCEL (2): `FileDownlink` is canceling a file downlink.

* WAIT (3): `FileDownlink` is waiting for a buffer to be returned before sending another packet.

* COOLDOWN (4): `FileDownlink` is waiting in a cooldown period before downlinking the next file.

The initial value is IDLE.

### 3.6 Commands

`FileDownlink` recognizes the commands described in the following sections.

#### 3.6.1 SendFile/SendPartial

SendFile is an asynchronous command that adds a file to the file downlink queue.
It has two arguments:

1. *sourceFileName*: The name of the on-board file to send.
2. *destFileName*: The name of the destination file on the ground.

SendPartial also includes the following fields:

3. *offset*: Position in file to start reading from.
4. *length*: Amount of data to read. A length of 0 reads until the end of file.

When the downlink completes or fails, a CmdResponse packet will be sent indicating success or
failure.

#### 3.6.2 Cancel

Cancel is a synchronous command.
If *mode* = DOWNLINK, it sets *mode* to CANCEL.
Otherwise it does nothing.
