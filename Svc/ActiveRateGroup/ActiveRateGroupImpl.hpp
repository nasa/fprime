    //! \class ActiveRateGroupImpl
    //! \brief Executes a set of components as part of a rate group
    //!
    //! ActiveRateGroup takes an input cycle call to begin the rate group cycle.
    //! It calls each output port in succession and passes the value in the context
    //! array at the index corresponding to the output port number. It keeps track of the execution
    //! time of the rate group and detects overruns.
    //!

            //!  \brief ActiveRateGroupImpl constructor
            //!
            //!  The constructor of the class clears all the flags and copies the
            //!  contents of the context array to private storage.
            //!
            //!  \param compName Name of the component
            //!  \param contexts Array of integers that contain the context values that will be sent
            //!         to each member component. The index of the array corresponds to the
            //!         output port number.
            //!  \param numContexts The number of elements in the context array.

            //!

            //!  ports and the component base class
            //!
