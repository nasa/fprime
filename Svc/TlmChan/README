This directory defines an implementation class for the Tlm component base class. It implements telemetry storage as a table accessed by the telemetry ID. 
It has two alternate implementations. One does a linear lookup to find the telemetry entry in the table based on the telemetry ID. This is more space efficient,
but has slower performance because the table is traversed each time. The second uses the telemetry ID as an index into the table. It is faster but can be space 
inefficient if there are disjoint telemetry IDs. Which version is used can be done by putting the desired file in the mod.mk file.

TelemChannelImpl.hpp(.cpp) - implementation of the common functions of the telemetry storage
TelemChannelImpIndex.cpp - implements lookup by using the telemetry ID as an array index
TelemChannelLookup.cpp - implements lookup by traversing the table and looking for the ID
TelemChanTask.cpp - implements the rate group handler to write the telemetry to the downlink
TlmChanImplCfg.hpp - Contains configuration values for the component
