This component takes a primary clock tick in the system and divides it down to drive output ports.
Constructor arguments define the divisors for each port.
The dividers argument define the divisors for each port as well as an offset to allow the triggering
for the rate group to be offset from each other.
The output ports are meant to be connected to the input ports of rate groups to drive them at the
correct rate.
