# System Resources Component

The system resources component downlinks information about the running FÂ´ system. This information includes:

1. System and Software version
2. Free Memory
3. CPU load
4. Disk space

These items are downlinked as telemetry channels in response to a rate group port invocation.

**Note:** system resources requires `U64` types to be available on the target architecture.
