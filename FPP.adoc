= FPP

This branch contains a partial FPP (F Prime Prime) model of
the F Prime core distribution.

== Requirements

To build the FPP model, first do the following:

. Install the
https://github.com/bocchino/redo[redo]
build system.

. Install the
https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp[FPP compiler].

== Building the Model

To build the FPP model, run `redo -j4` at the command line.
The system will detect the available FPP files and
use them to generate the corresponding F Prime XML files.
