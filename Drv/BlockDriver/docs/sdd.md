# Drv::BlockDriver Component

## 1. Introduction

The `Drv::BlockDriver` is a demonstration component that loops back data buffers. It also emulates a timing interrupt driven by the public method `void callIsr(void)`.

## 2. Requirements

The requirements for `Drv::BlockDriver` are as follows:

Requirement | Description | Verification Method
----------- | ----------- | -------------------
ISF-BDV-001 | The `Drv::BlockDriver` component shall loop back packets from its input port to its output port | System test
ISF-BDV-002 | The `Drv::BlockDriver` component shall send a timing interrupt whenever `callIsr()` is invoked | System test
