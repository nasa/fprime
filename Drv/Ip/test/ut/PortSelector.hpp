/**
 * \brief returns a (currently) unused port
 *
 * Tests working with TCP often need ports to be unused. This presents a problem when looking to bind to a port that has
 * not been used anywhere on the system.  This function will walk the process through to the point of getting a bind,
 * and use the port 0 to have the OS assign one.  At this point, the assigned port will be inspected and the fd will be
 * closed without a connection allowing something else to bind to it e.g the test code.
 *
 * Note: this is test code only as there is a known race condition from the moment of closing the port, to when the
 * recipient binds it again.
 *
 * \param is_udp: is this a UDP port
 * \return 0 on error, or a free port on success
