# 'RPI' Deployment:
#
# This sets up the build for the 'RPI' Application, including the custom
# components. In addition, it imports FPrime.cmake, which includes the core F Prime
# components.
#
# This file has several sections.
#
# 1. Header Section: define basic properties of the build
# 2. F prime core: includes all F prime core components, and build-system properties
# 3. Local subdirectories: contains all deployment specific directory additions
####

##
# Section 1: Basic Project Setup
#
# This contains the basic project information. Specifically, a cmake version and
# project definition.

##
# Section 2: F prime Core
#
# This includes all of the F prime core components, and imports the make-system. F prime core
# components will be placed in the F-Prime binary subdirectory to keep them from
# colliding with deployment specific items.

# Note: when building a deployment outside of the F prime core directories, then the
# build root must be re-mapped for use with the standard build system components.
#
# In this way, the module names can be predicted as an offset from the (new) build
# root, without breaking the standard locations of F prime.

# Section 3: Components and Topology
#
# This section includes deployment specific directories. This allows use of non-
# core components in the topology, which is also added here.
