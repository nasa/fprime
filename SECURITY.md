# Security Policy

The F´ team secures our code base using a combination of code review, dependency review, and static analysis performed during automated pull request
verification. We welcome general bug reports and vulnerability reports from the larger community.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

For general defects, please submit a [Bug Report](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/new/choose)

To report a vulnerability for F´ please use the [vulnerability report form](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/security/advisories/new) or send a detailed
report to [fprime@jpl.nasa.gov](mailto:fprime@jpl.nasa.gov). 

### Static Analysis Checks

The [GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/blob/devel/.github/workflows/) are available to the public. To review the results, fork the
repository and run the workflows. 

These checks are run on each pull request submitted to F´.
