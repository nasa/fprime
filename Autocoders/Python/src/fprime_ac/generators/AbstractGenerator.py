# NAME:  AbstractGenerator.py
#
# DESCRIPTION: The abstract generator defines the interface
#                for each element or in this case
#              portion of code to be generated.  We use
#              the python __call__ method to make
#              direct calls to generators.
#
# USAGE: Normally these will be instanced by a Factory
#        then each one will have the needed visitors
#          added.
