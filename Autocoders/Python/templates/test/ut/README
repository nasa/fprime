NOTE:

To regenerate the example component, from Autocoders/Python/templates, type:
"make test_<host os>", where host_os = cygwin, linux, darwin.
Then copy the "ExampleComponentTestAc.cpp/.hpp" files to this directory. Change the header include in the .cpp file to match the unit test directory path.

Directory contents:

ComponentTest.cpp - Unit test program; contains main and instantiates components
ExampleComponentTestAc.cpp(.hpp) - Generated test component base class
TestComponentImpl.cpp(.hpp) - Developer-written test component.

mod.mk - make configuration file listing sources to build

test/ut - sample unit test for testing component
