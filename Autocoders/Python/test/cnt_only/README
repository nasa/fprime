Identical to app1 except that component initalization is manually handled in Top.cpp instead of being auto generated
in the topology.

Components are linked to the topology via Components.hpp.


Usage
"""""

Generate the topology with the -C and -P flags.
(Connection only and pointer flag)


Ex:

isfgen -b -C -P DuckTopologyAppAi.xml


Run:
	make
	make ut
	make run_ut

OR

Run:
	nosetests
