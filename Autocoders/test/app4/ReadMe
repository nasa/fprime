This is a PartitionHub Component which is a passive component (PartitionHubComponentAi.xml)
with serialized input and serialized output ports.
Yacgen requires a Port XML file so I also included a file called SerialPortAi.xml but
I'm not sure what is supposed to go into this file. At the moment its giberish.

The expected source output from yacgen is captured as:
PartitionHubPartitionHubComponentAcRef.cpp and PartitionHubPartitionHubComponentRef.hpp

The actual output from yacgen is currently:
PartitionHubPartitionHubComponentAcRef.cpp and PartitionHubPartitionHubComponentRef.hpp

Do a diff between the two sets of files to find the defects.

Also included in this directory is the ac.ini file.

I have also made changes to the component base class. We need to overload the setoutput port functions for serialized data.
See the differences in the Duck model. Reference and XML are provided.
