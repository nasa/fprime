# From Design review, it was requested that we add more trace types such as
# interrupts, exceptions, context switch,queue add/remove, EVRs, 
# semaphore takes(?), stack trace, DMA
# Also consider adding state machine transitions, timer acquisition 
# and release traces, and EVRS to the category of traces that are automated. 
# Also consider what a potential IO trace could look like. A ring buffer for IO 
# is always requested for 1553 and recently M-Bus on Psyche. Presumably a 
# limited IO trace of some could be packaged with the autopsy log and be useful.
    
#Note: Trace Types are configurable by the project and defined here. 
#      It is stored as a bitmask that will be used for log filtering.
#      Current design allows a max of 16 trace types
