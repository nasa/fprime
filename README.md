<hr>

F´ (F Prime) is a component-driven framework that enables rapid development and deployment of spaceflight and other embedded software applications. Originally developed at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), F´ has been successfully deployed on [several space applications](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/projects.html). It is tailored but not limited to small-scale spaceflight systems such as CubeSats, SmallSats, and instruments.

**Please Visit the F´ Website:** [https://nasa.github.io/fprime](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/).  This website contains project information, user guides, documentation, tutorials, and more!

## What does F´ provide
- An architecture that decomposes flight software into discrete components with well-defined interfaces
- A C++ framework that provides core capabilities such as message queues and threads
- Modeling tools for specifying components and connections and automatically generating code
- A growing collection of ready-to-use components
- Testing tools for testing flight software at the unit and integration levels.
