# F' (fprime)

F' is a component-driven embedded framework originally developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It enables developers to quickly design and deploy full embedded system architectures built around resuable components.

F' uses code generation and XML design files to enable developers to quickly create solutions in the embedded space, while minimizing the ammount of boiler plate code theat the developer must write.


## F' Resources

A quick start guide can be found [here.](http://nasa.github.io/fprime/getting-started.md). Use this for information on how to quickly setup and run F' using custom components and a custom topology. This quick start clones the below reference application, which comes with separate documentation.

The Reference application is shipped as part of F'. Documentation for this reference application can be found [here.](Ref/docs/sdd.md).

The full F' User's guide can be found [here.](docs/UsersGuide/FprimeUserGuide.pdf) In addition, the F' architectural overview can be found [here.](docs/Architecture/FPrimeArchitectureShort.pdf).
