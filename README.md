</p>

#
F´ (F Prime) is a component-driven framework that enables rapid development and deployment of spaceflight and other embedded software applications. Originally developed at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), F´ has been successfully deployed on [several space applications](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/projects.html). It is tailored but not limited to small-scale spaceflight systems such as CubeSats, SmallSats, and instruments.

**Please Visit the F´ Website:** [https://nasa.github.io/fprime](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/) for more information.


## What does F´ provide

- An architecture that decomposes flight software into discrete components with well-defined interfaces
- A C++ framework that provides core capabilities such as message queues and threads
- Modeling tools for specifying components and connections and automatically generating code
- A growing collection of ready-to-use components
- Testing tools for testing flight software at the unit and integration levels.

Learn more about F' key features [here](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/features.html).


## System Requirements

1. Linux, Windows with WSL, or macOS operating system
2. git
3. [CMake 3.16+](https://cmake.org/download/). CLI tool must be available on the system path.
4. CLang or GNU C and C++ compilers (e.g. gcc and g++)
5. [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), virtual environments, and PIP


## Getting Started

To get started with F´, install the F´ toolset with:
```
pip install fprime-tools
```

Then, create a new project with:
```
fprime-util new --project
```

See the [HelloWorld Tutorial](https://fprime-community.github.io/fprime-tutorial-hello-world/) to guide you through all the steps of developing an F´ project.
